# Conjugate Gradient Method on Hilbert Matrix

This assignment was a part of a course on Computational Methods of Optimization (E0 230), taught by Dr. Chiranjib Bhattacharya at IISc, Bangalore in Fall, 2019.

## Objective
1. To create a Hilbert matrix and apply Conjugate Gradient method on it.
2. Plot the results with 64-bit and 128-bit decimal precisions.

## Conclusion
On a 20x20 matrix with 64-bit precision, the Conjugate Gradient method took 67 iterations. With 128-bit precision, the method took only 12 iterations.  
The numerical instability increased the number of iterations by sometimes increasing the error norm.
